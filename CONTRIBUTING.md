# Contributing Guide

This is the homepage of the small community called "The Urban Brothers". If you want to commit a bugfix or something similar, you are more than welcome, but nobody expects this to be a community driven project.

If you want to do something however, you may create an `Issue` and then fork the project, do your stuff in a separate branch and create a `Pull Request` as soon as you are ready.

Thank you for your help!

Any suggestions and/ or bug reports may be created inside `Issues`.
